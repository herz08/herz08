- 👋 Hi, I’m @herz08.<br> 
      I'm a Softwaredeveloper from Germany and working for a software company of a media group in East Westphalia, guess who.<br>
      This is my private page and has nothing to do with my projects in my company.<br>
- 👀 I’m interested in Arduino, ESP32, Oracle Apex, PL/SQL, Javascript 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use the MLE of the Oracle Database 21c
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (not really sure)
- 📫 How to reach me github@vogtherzog.de
